<!-- @IMPORT -->

<!--

CSS should be compiled into a single file using a preprocessor like SASS or LESS using @import to first concatenate all stylesheets into a one. This should then be linked to from the head of each page.

Use <link> tag to add CSS to the <head> tag within pages as @import is slower and causes extra page requests to occur.

-->

<!-- Link -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">

<!-- Avoid this -->
<style>
  @import url("main.css");
</style>
